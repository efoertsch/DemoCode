# DemoCode
As you may suspect contains some demo code.<p>

1. Various methods to run background threads<p>
2. Bluetooth/Ble code including implementing Ble peripheral(server) code<p>
3. Sundery other stuff<p>

Updated as time and interest permit<p>

The demo code can continue code from Google code demo's, Stack Overflow or other sources but more often than not it has been modified -
somtimes to an unrecognizable amount. But I have tried to note where the code originated from.
